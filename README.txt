In folder "cancer" there are the script and the gene lists to generate the R output which is displayed at the supplementary
material of the paper "Equivalence test based on the Sorensen - Dice index for comparison of feature lists".
In folder "kidney" there is the script and data corresponding to the analysis of the PBTs data on kidney rejection after 
transplantation.
Both scripts perform a 'source' statement of the script "adjSignifPvals.R" and require a previous installation on
your R system of the package "goSorensen", available at GitHub, and its dependencies, all available at CRAN or Bioconductor.
In order to avoid problems, we recommend running these examples under a folder structure exactly mimicking the one at repository
https://github.com/pablof1988/sorensenEquivScripts, i.e., as a consequence of cloning it or dowloading its ZIP file.
