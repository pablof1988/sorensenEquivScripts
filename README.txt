In folder "cancer" you have the script and the gene lists to generate the R output which is displayed at the supplementary
material of the paper "Equivalence test based on the Sorensen - Dice index for comparison of feature lists".
In folder "kidney" there is the script and data corresponding to the analysis of the PBTs data on kidney rejection.
Both scripts perform a 'source' statement of the script "adjSignifPvals.R" and require a previous installation on
your R system of the packages "goSorensen" and "equivStandardTest", both available at GitHub.
